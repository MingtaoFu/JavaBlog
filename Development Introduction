Development Introduction

Please use TomEE(jax-rs) instead of TomCat, I'm sorry.
The configure method is same as TomCat.

All source documents are in "src" that contains 3 packages, including "DA", "PD" and "Service".
Service package contains the classes related to Front End.The classes are composed of some block written as
    "Path('api/greeting')".So we can execute a function through visiting the Url "localhost:8080/api/greeting".
    Please make sure that "api" is in every Url, such as "api/login", "api/article/1", etc.
PD package contains the main classes like "User", "Article", etc.
DA package contains the classes related to database(MySQL).

About Git
Please run "git pull" before you push your code.

Please introduce the module when you commit.
For example, when you finish the "publish article" module, you should commit as
    "git commit -m 'article: publish article'".
